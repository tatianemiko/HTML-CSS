            Holdin' me back
            Gravity's holdin' me back
            I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
            Why don't we leave it at that?
            Nothin' to say
            When everything gets in the way
            Seems you cannot be replaced
            And I'm the one who will stay,
        </p>

                oh
                In this world, it's just us
                You know it's not the same as it was
                In this world, it's just us
                You know it's not the same as it was
                As it was, as it was
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            You know it's not the same
            Answer the phone
            "Harry, you're no good alone
            Why are you sittin' at home on the floor?
            What kind of pills are you on?"
            Ringin' the bell
            And nobody's comin' to help
            Your daddy lives by himself
            He just wants to know that you're well, oh
            In this world, it's just us
            You know it's not the same as it was
            In this world, it's just us
            You know it's not the same as it was
            As it was, as it was

        <div class="imagem">
            <p>
                You know it's not the same
                Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
                I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
                <strong>Leave America</strong>, two kids follow her

        <p>
            I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
            As it was
            You know it's not the same as it was
            As it was, as it was
