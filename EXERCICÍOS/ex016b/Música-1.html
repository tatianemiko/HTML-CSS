            Every second counts <br>
            I don't wanna talk to you anymore, and <br>
            All these little games <br>
            You can call me by the name I gave you<br>
            Yesterday, yeah<br>
            Every minute counts<br>
            I don't wanna watch TV anymore, yeah<br>
            Can you figure me out?<br>
            Just doin' to waste more time on the couch<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time<br>
            I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine<br>
            Can you see me using everything to hold back?<br>
            I guess this could be worse<br>
            Walkin' out the door with your bags<br>
            Walkin' out the door with your bags<br>
            Walkin' out the door with your bags<br>
            Walkin' out the door with your bags<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Pour your glass of wine<br>
            Mitchell told me I should be just fine, yeah<br>
            Cases under the bed<br>
            Spill it open, let it rush to my head<br>
            I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners<br>
            Savor this with everything I have inside of me<br>
            I'm not the type to run, I know that we're having fun<br>
            But what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Tell you how I felt<br>
            Sugar coated melting in your mouth<br>
            Pardon my emotions<br>
            I should probably keep it all to myself<br>
            Know you'd make fun of me<br>
            Know you'd make fun of me<br>
            Know you'd make fun of me<br>
            Know you'd make fun of me<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time<br>
            I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine<br>
            Can you see me using everything to hold back?<br>
            I guess this could be worse<br>
            Walkin' out the door with your bags<br>
            Walkin' out the door with your bags<br>
            Walkin' out the door with your bags<br>
            Walkin' out the door with your bags</p>
